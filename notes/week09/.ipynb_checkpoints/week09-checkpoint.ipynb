    "Section 4.1 is long. It shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regular, context-free, decidable, and Turing-recognizable languages form a hierarchy (Figure 4.10).\n",
    "- Some results about regular and context-free languages that are interesting in their own right, like the fact that you can test whether two DFAs are equivalent. (We used this fact to partially automate the grading of one exam question.)\n",
    "- A more subtle point is that _a priori_ we might think that some context-free languages are not decidable. For a PDA can have a computation branch that goes on forever. But in fact, it's possible to simulate the PDA so that infinite computation branches can be detected and cut short.\n",

    "### Universal Turing machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus for today is the universal TM $U$ defined at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 4.11. It is a TM that can simulate another TM. We've talked many times in this class about machines that simulate other machines (for example, the DFA for the intersection of two regular languages simulates the two machines that recognize the two languages), but whereas in those cases, the simulated machine was always hard-coded into the simulator, the universal TM is different because the code of the simulated machine is _part of the input_. That is, it takes as input both the code of a TM $M$ and an input string $w$, and simulates what $M$ would do on $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some reason, the book deemphasizes this idea. It's significant not only because of its relevance to Theorem 4.11, but also because it gave rise to (or at least anticipated) the idea of a stored program computer. To make the idea of a UTM more concrete, let's sketch what it would look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to show how to encode a TM as a string. This is easy to do and the details are not important, but it's worth at least mentioning one way to do it for concreteness. Turing's original encoding used an alphabet $\\{\\mathtt{A}, \\mathtt{C}, \\mathtt{D}, \\mathtt{L}, \\mathtt{R}, \\mathtt{N}\\}$. If the states in $Q$ are numbered $q_1, q_2, \\ldots$, then state $q_i$ is encoded as $\\mathtt{DA}^i$. If the symbols in $\\Gamma$ are numbered $a_0, a_1, \\ldots$, where $a_0$ is the blank symbol, then symbol $a_i$ is encoded as $\\mathtt{DC}^i$. Then, the transition $\\delta(q_i, a_j) = (q_k, a_\\ell, \\textrm{L})$ is encoded as $\\mathtt{DA}^i \\mathtt{DC}^j \\mathtt{DC}^\\ell \\mathtt{L} \\mathtt{DA}^k$, and similarly if the move is R or N (for \"no move,\" equivalent to the book's S). We also need some convention for indicating the start, accept, and reject states: perhaps $q_1$ is always the start state, $q_2$ the accept state, and $q_3$ the reject state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we have to show the universal TM itself. It is often constructed as a TM with three tapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An encoding of $M$, the machine being simulated.\n",
    "2. The tape of $M$.\n",
    "3. The state of $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation description would be: On input $\\langle M, w\\rangle$, where $M$ is a TM and $w$ is a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy $M$ onto tape 1 and $w$ onto tape 2.\n",
    "2. Initialize tape 3 to the start state of $M$.\n",
    "3. Repeat:\n",
    "   1. If the state (tape 3) is the accept state, _accept_; if it is the reject state, _reject_.\n",
    "   2. Search on tape 1 for an instruction that matches the current state (encoded on tape 3) and current input symbol (encoded on tape 2).\n",
    "   3. Write the new state to tape 3 and the new symbol to tape 2.\n",
    "   4. Move the head on tape 2 to the left or right as indicated by the instruction."

If you are not familiar with these concepts and Cantor's diagonalization argument, pay careful attention to this subsection, even though it may not seem relevant at first. The point of this digression is that the vast majority of languages are _not_ Turing-recognizable (or decidable).\n",

(In the 2nd edition of the book, this subsection (beginning on page 179) is misleadingly called \"The Halting Problem.\" But the language $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ is _not_ the halting problem, and this subsection was rightly retitled \"An Undecidable Language\" in the 3rd edition.) What would it mean for $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ to be decidable? We saw previously that even if a NFA or PDA has an infinite loop, we can convert it into one that doesn't have an infinite loop; so we didn't make a distinction between NFA-recognizable and NFA-decidable, or PDA-recognizable and PDA-decidable. Similarly, if $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ were decidable, we'd be able to convert any TM into a decider TM, and we wouldn't make a distinction between Turing-recognizable and Turing-decidable.\n",
